/* intel_axi4lite_injector_ph2

   The AXI4 Lite injector provides a way for AXI4 Lite masters in customer designs to interact with 
   registers in the periphery without needing a dedicated FP NOC INIU. This is acheived by providing
   an AXI4 master interface that can be directly connected to an INIU, and an AXI4 slave interface
   identical to that of an INIU except that the AXI ID signals are one bit narrower than that of an
   INIU. On the INIU interface that bit is used to indicate whether the transaction originates from
   the mainband AXI4 slave, or one of the AXI4 Lite slave interfaces. The corresponding response ID
   bit is used to steer responses back to the originating interface. 

   This module provides four AXI Lite interfaces, of which 1 to 4 can be active. This style of
   configuration with a fixed port list is intended to serve deployment as a Platform Designer IP,
   which would have a TCL generated top level wrapper that hides ports for interfaces not required
   by the customer design. 

   The AXI4 mainband slave interface can also be configured as inactive if desired.

   Arbitration:

   Arbitration works the same way for the AR, AW, and W channels and is therefore handled by the 
   same logic in all cases. 

   There are two steps to arbitration: determining which AXI Lite channel should be considered
   for access to the INIU, and determining whether mainband or AXI-lite traffic should win the
   arbitration. 

   Since the number of in-flight commands or data-writes are tracked per AXI Lite interface, the
   arbitration between AXI Lite interfaces can be based on this information: The interface with
   the fewest in-flight commands/data beats wins. Ties are broken by preferring one of the 
   interfaces that did not win the previous arbitration. 

   To determine whether mainband traffic or the winner of the AXI-Lite arbitration should enter
   the INIU, the logic is configured with an upper bound on AXI-Lite INIU cycle share during
   times of contention with mainband traffic. More accurately, this is the fraction of cycles
   in which mainband traffic automatically takes precedence over AXI-Lite traffic. 

   On a cycle in which AXI-Lite traffic is permitted to contend with mainband traffic, the mainband
   stream is backpressured if AXI-Lite traffic arbitration has a winner (this part of the logic 
   has a big impact on fMax!). On cycles where there is no mainband command/data offered for 
   transfer, the AXI Lite automatically wins and this cycle does not count against the 
   contended traffic limit. 

   Due to the nature of register accesses this traffic should not offer significant contention with
   mainband traffic of real customer designs. Configuration register accesses are rare, and polling 
   traffic is limited by the high latency (> 100ns) of AXI Lite accesses across the FP NOC and onto 
   the low-bandwidth CSR access NOC.  

   Ready latency:

   The AXI Lite interfaces and user-facing mainband interfaces are fully compliant with the AXI4
   specification and therefore have ready latency = 0. In principle the INIU interfaces could have
   a non-zero ready latency, but currently only zero ready latency is supported on that interface.

   Backpressure generation:
   
   Upstream readies are forced low when the response FIFOs are no longer able to absorb any more
   responses in addition to the responses to commands that have already been accepted. 

   Parameters:
       NUM_ACTIVE_AXI4LITE_S_INTERFACES 
           How many of the user-facing AXI4Lite interfaces are actually used in the customer design
           - must be <= 4
       AXI4LITE_QOS
           AXI4 QoS to be used when converting Lite transactions into full mainband transactions. 
           Defaults to zero. The selected QoS is not taken into account during arbitration. 
           Permissible values are 0 to 15.
       NUM_ACTIVE_AXI4_S_INTERFACES
           Number of AXI4 mainband slave interfaces that will be used by the customer design. 
           Can only be 0 or 1 - a value of 0 will save on mainband interface logic, especially FIFOs.
       BUFFER_AXI4_S_READ_RESPONSES
           If an AXI4 mainband slave interface will be exposed by the wrapper for this IP and this
           parameter is non-zero, a 32-deep MLAB FIFO will be implemented on the mainband R channel. 
           This means that R channel backpressure from the user design will not cause INIU backpressure
           (and thus block responses to AXI4 Lite reads) until the buffer is full.  
           The wide read response FIFO comes with an area penalty and may also affect fMax.
       AXI4_S_TRANSFER_MULTIPLE
           When there is contention between the AXI-Lite and AXI4 mainband interfaces, this parameter
           limits the AXI-Lite data transfers to approximately 1 every AXI4_S_TRANSFER_MULTIPLE 
           mainband data transfers. This limit is based on transfer rate on R and W rather than
           command rate, so that its behaviour is not dependent on mainband burst length.  
     
   Read address tracking:

   AXI Lite read commands only request 32 or 64 bits, and are therefore converted to mainband 
   narrow and potentially unaligned transfers (addresses are not divisible by the width of the
   mainband interface, which is 32 bytes). Therefore the 32 or 64 read response bits appear in
   different segments of the 256 bit INIU response, depending on the source address. There are
   at most 8 possible slices from which the response bits must be obtained, and therefore each
   AXI Lite interface has an associated read response slice FIFO - a 32-deep and 4 bit wide 
   MLAB FIFO. The high NOC latency may cause this FIFO to fill up, in which case the user's
   AXI Lite master must be back-pressured.   

   Clocking and resets:

   For compliance with the AXI4 specification, each AXI4 or AXI4 Lite interface has an associated
   clock and reset. To avoid wasting area on wide clock-crossing FIFOs, this IP requires that 
   the mainband interfaces have the same clock, unless the user-facing slave interface is not
   activated. However each active AXI4 Lite interface can have an independent clock. 

   Since a set of clock-crossing FIFOs must be instantiated for each AXI Lite interface, 
   this enables responses to AXI Lite commands to be handled in a way that does not backpressure
   the INIU (which would harm mainband throughput). The AXI4 Lite interface logic will not accept
   read or write commands unless there is sufficient space in the response FIFOs to absorb all
   outstanding responses. 

   The command multiplexing and response demultiplexing logic is driven and reset by the 
   clock and reset associated with the INIU-facing mainband master interface.

   TODO? non-zero ready latency on the INIU interfaces 
   TODO? additional arbitration schemes
   TODO? support unoc based 512b read response path. 
   TODO: check that in all cases the AXI4 reset spec (A3.1.2) is followed
   TODO? support INIU user-data width of zero. 
   TODO? Take AXI Lite QoS into account when chosing between mainband and AXI-Lite transactions. 

   TODO: enable and validate the 64-bit AXI4 Lite option (not yet validated as it is not needed for FP)

/* Per-slave logic.

   This module adapts the user-facing AXI Lite interface (in its own clock domain) to an internal
   interface in the INIU clock domain. The internal interface includes the usual AXI4 Lite AR, 
   AW, R, W, and B channels as well as an rdata slice selection FIFO to assist the read response
   demultiplexer. This is needed because the AXI Lite response bits will be a slice of the wider 
   read response from the INIU. That happens because the AXI Lite transfer is implemented as an
   AXI4 narrow transfer, in which the base address of a data beat is always a multiple of the 
   fundamental transfer width. 

   Per-slave logic includes command and response counters, the difference between which is used
   to override the FIFO reades on the AR, AW, and W channels. This limits the number of commands
   or responses in-transit and thereby ensures that the response FIFOs can never fill up. 

   For the same reason the FIFO used to convey read slice IDs to the read response demultiplexer
   should never fill up. This presumption is based on all FIFOs having the same depth! 

   This module tracks the slave's in-flight requests in two different ways:

   1. In order to prevent FIFO overflow due to the arrival of responses that have been handed
      off to the NOC, there is a AW/AR pair of counts of the total number of requests received 
      from the user design and for which the user has not accepted the corresponding response.
      This includes requests within the AR, AW, and W FIFOs. These counters exist in the user
      clock domain. 

   2. The second kind of in-flight counter is intended to support arbitration. These counters
      are similar to the FIFO-control counters but do not count requests within the AR and AW 
      FIFOs. The AXI-Lite arbitration stage prefers interfaces that have the least number of
      recently accepted transactions - and uses this information to back-pressure the AR and AW
      FIFOs. Therefore transactions within those FIFOs cannot be counted as "accepted".
      Being intended for use in arbitration, these counters operate in the downstream clock
      domain.

/* AXI-Lite arbitration

   The same arbitration logic is used for AR and AW, and is supposed to sit downstream
   of a set of clock-crossing FIFOs from the user's clock domain. 
   It also receives the in-flight request/response counts computed by the module owning the
   clock crossing FIFOs. These include all requests selected by arbitration and responses 
   that are buffered on their way to the user clock domain. Requests sitting in input 
   FIFOs are not taken into consideration.   

   User backpressure can result in in-flight count reflecting responsesu waiting in FIFOs 
   feeding the user design. That is useful because when user logic is not ready to receive
   results, commands from another soure should be preferred. 

   Arbitration uses a tree-structure to compare the in-flight command counts, and this
   implementation is hard-coded for a maximum of 4 AXI Lite interfaces. 
   However the principle is extensible to a larger number of interfaces.

   Note: since the comparison is multi-stage with registers between stages, "last winner" 
         state within the comparison module cannot take account of whether the
         previous cycle's winner won in the arbitration against mainband traffic.
         Therefore intermediate winner values will "ping-pong" when the candidates have
         the same number of in-flight requests. In a pathological case this may lead to 
         starvation - when mainband arbitration accepts every other AXI-Lite arbitration
         winner, and that AXI-Lite channel is consuming responses at exactly the same rate
         at which it is generating requests.
         
   The "comparison" sub-module immediately following the main module declaration performs
   a two-way comparison based on the in-flight transaction count, FIFO ready, and 
   previous winner status.

/* Ax channel merge module

   This module merges AXI-Lite command traffic onto the mainband interface.
   In the case of write commands, this action is coordinated with the W channel merge
   module. The W coordination takes wlast into account, so that a write command and
   its accompanying data from are injected at the same point in the mainband streams 
   to the INIU. When write tracking is enabled, the axilite_axvalid signal should
   only be asserted by external logic when _both_ the AW and W channels of the AXI 
   lite inteface have data available.  

   Write commands and data are taken from the AXI-Lite interface in the same cycle.
   There is only one AXI-Lite command interface, as arbitration between AXI-Lite
   interfaces is expected to occur between the customer facing interfaces and this
   module.   

   The module is parameterizable for read and write command interfaces; when merging
   read commands the TRACK_AXI4_S_W_TRANSFERS parameter should be set to zero. Then the
   wlast and wvalid inputs will be ignored, and wready will be driven to zero. 

   Since AW and W transfers need to be coordinated it is necessary to implement a
   FIFO on the upstream S_AXI4 AW channel, and delay acceptance of an S_AXI4 AW command
   until its data becomes available on W.

   The FIFO is optional on AR. Set FIFO_DEPTH_LOG2 to zero if a FIFO should not be
   instantiated. 

   AXI IDs are generated by prepending '1' for AXI-Lite transactions, and using the 
   ID of the originating interface for the low-order bits. 

   This module implements an AXI-Lite ingress limiter by matching a transfer from the
   output of the AXI-Lite domain with one or more data beats on the mainband interface. 
   Thus AXI-lite to AXI4 mainband transfer ratios of 1:1 (50%), 1:2 (33%), 1:3 (25%) 
   all the way through to 1:31 (3%) are possible. 

   TODO: wready de-assertion behaviour on the s_axi4 interface must be AXI-compliant or
         mediated by a FIFO, unless that interface isn't enabled. 

   TODO: Try to implement the S_AXI4 command interface without a FIFO. 

   TODO: (potentially) take flag indicating whether to ignore the AXI-Lite interface

/* Write response demultiplexer

   The BID bits are used to steer the response to the correct slave interface of the IP:
   * top bit indicates whether the response must go to a user AXI4Lite interface
   * the bottom 2 bits indicate which AXI4lite interface the response goes to.

   For this reason the AXI ID port facing the user design is 1 bit narrower than the 
   INIU-facing port. 

   An MLAB FIFO is employed on the B channel to the mainband slave interface, so that 
   brief periods of mainband backpressure do not interfere with the flow of AXI4Lite write 
   responses. Since the write response data path is so narrow, only a single MLAB is required. 

   It is assumed that the AXI4Lite interfaces already have FIFOs, and that the flow of
   AXI4Lite commands has been throttled so that those FIFOs will never overflow. Therefore
   backpressure from any of the AXI4Lite B channels is treated as an error condition.

/* Read response demultiplexer

   The RID bits are used to steer the response to the correct slave interface of the IP:
   * top bit indicates whether the response must go to a user AXI4Lite interface
   * the bottom 2 bits indicate which AXI4lite interface the response goes to.

   For this reason the AXI ID port facing the user design is 1 bit narrower than the 
   INIU-facing port. 

   Since the INIU R channel is 256 bits wide and the AXI Lite interfaces are much narrower
   (32 or 64 bits, of which 32 bits is typical of FP devices), this module needs to know
   which of the INIU R channel bits contain the response. This information is obtained from
   a "read response slice" FIFO for each AXI4 lite interface. The slice width is the same as
   the AXI4 Lite read response width, so for example a 256b wide INIU interface has 8 slices
   of 32 bits [it woid have been nice to use AXI ID bits to tag the expected slice, but that 
   could result in out-of-order responses which would not be expected by an AXI4 Lite master].

   If configured via the BUFFER_AXI4_S_READ_RESPONSES parameter, an MLAB FIFO is employed on 
   the R channel to the mainband slave interface, so that brief periods of mainband backpressure
   do not interfere with the flow of AXI4Lite read responses at times when there is a steady
   flow of mainband read responses. 
   
   This is an optional feature because it results in the instantiation of a nearly 300b wide 
   FIFO which consumes significant area and may affect fMax. 

   It is assumed that the AXI4Lite interfaces already have FIFOs, and that the flow of
   AXI4Lite commands has been throttled so that those FIFOs will never overflow. Therefore
   backpressure from any of the AXI4Lite R channels is treated as an error condition.

/* FIFO for AXI4-like command or write data channels with potentially different upstream and downstream (hardware-side)
   ready latencies. Ready latencies can be specified as 0 (standard AXI handshaking), 1, or 2. 
   By AXI like it is meant that the signals are as per AXI, but the transfer handshake permits a delay of 1 or 2 cycles
   between de-assertion of ready and the flow of data. The logic is robust in that it does not require the upstream logic
   to de-assert valid when ready has been de-asserted, and it correctly de-asserts valid to downstream logic in response
   to de-assertion of ready from downstream. 
   This version of the module uses the standard scfifo IP which is known to limit fMax on Hyperflex devices and may
   therefore need to switch to a different FIFO IP such as fifo2. 
   The FIFO is always implemented in MLABs. LOG2_DEPTH of 5 results in very similar resource utilization to all smaller depths.

/* clock crossing fifo, adapted from the backpressure tester's fifo module
   This module places no expectations on the relationship between clock and reset, leveraging 
   the dcfifo reset synchronization option to aviod race conditions and enabling the user of 
   the module to use either upstream or downstream reset at will.   
   The almost_full condition cannot be directly obtained from a dcfifo, so must be based on rdusedw.
   The dcfifo takes 2 cycles to reflect writes in wrusedw, and there is an internal register
   stage in this module's conversion of wrusedw to wralmostfull. Therefore upstream is backpressured when
   rdusedw >= (2**LOG2_DEPTH) - (UPSTREAM_READY_LATENCY+4)
